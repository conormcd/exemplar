About
-----

Exemplar is a program designed to make it easier to work with XML. It began
life as a program to generate the smallest possible parser for a given
vocabulary of XML. While it still retains the capability to do this, it is now
a more general program intended to support conversion of specifications of XML
vocabularies (DTDs, Schemas, etc) into useful code.

Exemplar is designed to support plug-in moduless to implement input
translators, output producers and user/application interfaces. This should make
it easier to add features to Exemplar and/or integrate it with third-party
products.

How To Build
------------

If you got Exemplar as a source distribution, you have to build it before you
can use it. If you can't or don't want to build Exemplar, then go back to where
you got the source distribution and fetch the binary version instead.

Building a JAR should be as easy as typing `ant jar' in the directory that you
found this README file. The resulting Exemplar.jar can be found in the `dist'
directory.

Of course, sometimes it just isn't that easy. :-) You must have the following:

1) A Java compiler
2) Ant
3) JFlex
4) CUP

The JFlex and CUP JAR files must be in your classpath.

How to Use
----------

Read the documentation. :-) OK, here's a quick intro.

As a command line app:

java -jar /path/to/Exemplar.jar --input /path/to/vocabulary.dtd
	--output-language Java --output-api SAX2 --vocabulary vocabulary

As an Ant task:

<taskdef name="exemplar" classname="com.mcdermottroe.exemplar.ui.ant.Task" />
<exemplar	input="/path/to/vocabulary.dtd"
			output-language="Java"
			output-api="SAX2"
			vocabulary="vocabulary"
/>

Now read the documentation. :-)

 * All files under java_cup in the generated JAR file

   When Exemplar is built, it copies portions of the CUP parser runtime into
   the Exemplar JAR file. All of these files are under the CUP license which is
   as follows:

	performance of this software. 

   These files are required and Exemplar will not run correctly without them.

Any software produced by Exemplar is not covered by the license, even those
parts which are copied from files that *are* covered by the license. If you
need something clearer legally, then contact me and we can work something out.

If the license for Exemplar is not suitable for your needs I am open to
supplying the program to you under a different license. If you or your company
refuses to use the default license, please contact me and describe why you
can't use it and I'll try to accomodate you. I can't guarantee that we'll come
to an agreement, but I'll try to be as flexible as possible.
