About
-----

Exemplar is a program designed to make it easier to work with XML. It began
life as a program to generate the smallest possible parser for a given
vocabulary of XML. While it still retains the capability to do this, it is now
a more general program intended to support conversion of specifications of XML
vocabularies (DTDs, Schemas, etc) into useful code.

Exemplar is designed to support plug-in moduless to implement input
translators, output producers and user/application interfaces. This should make
it easier to add features to Exemplar and/or integrate it with third-party
products.

How To Build
------------

If you got Exemplar as a source distribution, you have to build it before you
can use it. If you can't or don't want to build Exemplar, then go back to where
you got the source distribution and fetch the binary version instead.

Building a JAR should be as easy as typing `ant jar' in the directory that you
found this README file. The resulting Exemplar.jar can be found in the `dist'
directory.

Of course, sometimes it just isn't that easy. :-) You must have the following:

1) A Java compiler
2) Ant
3) JFlex
4) CUP

The JFlex and CUP JAR files must be in your classpath.

To build any other part of the project, consult the Developer's Handbook.

How to Use
----------

Read the documentation. :-) OK, here's a quick intro.

As a command line app:

java -jar /path/to/Exemplar.jar --input /path/to/vocabulary.dtd
	--output-language Java --output-api SAX2 --vocabulary vocabulary

As an Ant task:

<taskdef name="exemplar" classname="com.mcdermottroe.exemplar.ui.ant.Task" />
<exemplar	input="/path/to/vocabulary.dtd"
			output-language="Java"
			output-api="SAX2"
			vocabulary="vocabulary"
/>

Now read the documentation. :-)

What to do if you find a bug
----------------------------

Try to reproduce it. The easier it is to reproduce, the easier it is to fix.
Send me a bug report with as much information as possible. The following is the
minimum I reccommend:

1) The JVM you're using.
2) Where you got Exemplar and how you compiled it (if you did).
3) The output of --help
4) The input that you need to use to reproduce the bug
5) The output (if any) when the bug has been tickled.
6) The output (if different) when you run Exemplar with --debug

The more detail you send, the better.

Submit all bug reports to the issue tracker. The list of known issues is
located at http://code.google.com/p/exemplar/issues/list and you can submit
your bug there.

If you're willing to have a go at fixing the bug, feel free to do so. I'll
answer any questions about the code that you need.

Once you've submitted your bug I'll try and get back to you with my first
impressions of the bug and how long it will be before I can fix it. You can
probably count on bugs being processed in the following order:

1) Bugs that are submitted with code to fix the error and JUnit tests to
   ensure that the bug won't sneak back into the code in future.
2) Bugs that are submitted with code to fix the error.
3) Bugs that are submitted with JUnit code to reproduce the error.
4) Bugs that are submitted with instructions on how to reproduce the error.
5) Bugs that can be reproduced.
6) Bugs that are intermittent and hard to pin down.
7) Bugs that have fixes supplied under a license incompatible with that
   of Exemplar.

Licensing
---------

The license for Exemplar is found in the LICENSE file and in every source file.

The following are not covered by the license for Exemplar:
 * All files under dtds/docbook-xml-42

   The license can be found in the dtds/docbook-xml-42/docbookx.dtd file.

   This directory is only needed for testing and can be removed without
   affecting the functionality of Exemplar.

 * All files under dtds/docbook-xml-44

   The license can be found in the dtds/docbook-xml-44/docbookx.dtd file.

   This directory is only needed for testing and can be removed without
   affecting the functionality of Exemplar.

 * The file res/skeleton.nested

   This file is required and Exemplar will not build correctly without it.

 * All files under java_cup in the generated JAR file

   When Exemplar is built, it copies portions of the CUP parser runtime into
   the Exemplar JAR file. All of these files are under the CUP license which is
   as follows:

	Copyright 1996-1999 by Scott Hudson, Frank Flannery, C. Scott Ananian

	Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its
	documentation for any purpose and without fee is hereby granted, provided
	that the above copyright notice appear in all copies and that both the
	copyright notice and this permission notice and warranty disclaimer appear
	in supporting documentation, and that the names of the authors or their
	employers not be used in advertising or publicity pertaining to
	distribution of the software without specific, written prior permission.

	The authors and their employers disclaim all warranties with regard to this
	software, including all implied warranties of merchantability and fitness.
	In no event shall the authors or their employers be liable for any special,
	indirect or consequential damages or any damages whatsoever resulting from
	loss of use, data or profits, whether in an action of contract, negligence
	or other tortious action, arising out of or in connection with the use or
	performance of this software. 

Any software produced by Exemplar is not covered by the license, even those
parts which are copied from files that *are* covered by the license. If you
need something clearer legally, then contact me and we can work something out.

If the license for Exemplar is not suitable for your needs I am open to
supplying the program to you under a different license. If you or your company
refuses to use the default license, please contact me and describe why you
can't use it and I'll try to accomodate you. I can't guarantee that we'll come
to an agreement, but I'll try to be as flexible as possible.

Packaging
---------

If you would like to package Exemplar for distribution via your favourite
operating system's package management system please let me know. I can provide
extra targets in the build to produce packing lists or any other meta-data you
need for packaging the program.

Please Contribute
-----------------

Exemplar is an open source project and as such I encourage all users to get
involved in its development as much as possible. You don't need to be a coder
to help out; writing documentation, finding bugs and making suggestions about
what you think should be included in Exemplar are all helpful activities.

The only hard and fast rule about contributing is that your contributions must
be supplied under a license compatible with that of Exemplar. Ideally, they
would be under the same BSD-style license. If you don't have the right to
contribute material, please don't! I don't want any legal battles!
