		<title>Description</title>

		<para><command>Exemplar</command> is a tool for processing <link 
				linkend="XML">XML</link> vocabulary descriptions (currently 
				just <link linkend="XML">DTD</link>s) into useful code.
		</para>

		<para><command>Exemplar</command> was originally designed to produce 
				the smallest possible XML parser for a given vocabulary. The
				idea was that by restricting the vocabulary of XML one could
				&quot;cut corners&quot; within the parser. This was found to be
				only partially true. To generate smaller parsers, one only
				needs to know what features of XML the vocabulary makes use of.
				For example, whether or not a vocabulary defines attributes for
				some elements is much more important than knowing the exact
				content models of the elements in the vocabulary. Exemplar can
				create SAX 1.0 parsers that are approximately 5-10KB.
		</para>

		<para><command>Exemplar</command> fully parses vocabulary descriptions 
				and creates a model of the vocabulary. The current goals are to
				use the model of the vocabulary to perform tasks other than
				creating small parsers, such as creating faster parsers or
				auto-generating the code needed to make full use of a parsed
				XML document.

					<para>The DTD output module does not work correctly. It

		<title>History</title>

		<para>Exemplar began life as a university project submitted during
				the spring of 2004 by Conor McDermottroe as part of the final
				examinations for a BA (Mod.) Computer Science at Trinity
				College, Dublin. The curious may request a copy of the software
				and the accompanying report from:
				<address>
					<otheraddr>Department of Computer Science,</otheraddr>
					<otheraddr>O&apos;Reilly Institute,</otheraddr>
					<otheraddr>Trinity College,</otheraddr>
					<postcode>Dublin 2,</postcode>
					<country>Ireland.</country>
				</address>
		</para>
		<para>The project then lay dormant for several months before being
				restarted with the intention of releasing it as an Open Source
				project. It went through some extensive refactoring to make it
				easier and more pleasant to modify. Of course, this should
				probably have been done while it was a university project, but
				unfortunately it was not possible to declare that it would be
				delivered &quot;when it&apos;s ready&quot;. :-)
		</para>
		<para>As of %%DATE%%, Exemplar has been an Open Source project
				available for all interested parties. A brief description of
				all known versions of the project is laid out below.
		</para>
		<note>
			<title>Version Numbering</title>
			<para><command>Exemplar</command>&apos;s version numbers are of the
					form A.B or A.B.C where A is a major number signifying a
					major milestone or a fundamental change in the behaviour of
					Exemplar, B is a release intended for use by end-users and
					C is a milestone number marking internal progress. Hence
					0.1 is the first release version of the software and 0.1.0
					is the same piece of software with any modifications made
					after the release but before the first milestone. In
					general it is not reccommended to use an A.B.C version of
					the program unless you wish to help debug it.

		<refsect2>
			<title>0.0.1 (2006-02-19)</title>
			<para>Extensive refactoring work which changed almost every part of
					the code. The purpose of the work was to allow easier
					modification of the project by third parties.
			</para>

		<refsect2>
			<title>0.0.2 (2006-04-18)</title>
			<para>A large &quot;clean-up&quot; of the source code to repair any

					hacks from the code base as possible.

		<refsect2>
			<title>0.0.3 (2006-08-06)</title>
			<para>Completion of the skeleton of the testing framework which was
					started near the milestone of 0.0.1. This covers basic
					JUnit testing, some Checkstyle checks and the beginning of
					a framework for testing the program by running it with all
					option permutations.
			</para>
		</refsect2>
		<refsect2>
			<title>0.0.4 (2006-09-08)</title>
			<para>Finishing work on the initial documentation. This included
